## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Perceptron is one of the earliest and simplest supervised learning algorithms used in machine learning for binary classification tasks. This project demonstrates the core logic behind how a perceptron works â€” including forward pass, thresholding, and weight updates â€” all written in pure Python without external libraries.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

The Perceptron follows this basic learning rule:

- Compute the output `y`:
